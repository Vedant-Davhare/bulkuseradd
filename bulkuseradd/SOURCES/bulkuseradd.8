.SH NAME
bulkuseradd \- A professional script for bulk user creation and management.

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B bulkuseradd
[\fIOPTIONS\fR] [\fIUSERNAMES...\fR]
.br
.B bulkuseradd
\fB-f\fR \fIFILE\fR [\fIOPTIONS\fR]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B bulkuseradd
is an advanced command-line utility designed for system administrators to create multiple user accounts efficiently. 
It allows batch user creation from command-line arguments or an input file, supports group assignments, password settings, UID management, logging, and custom shell configurations.

Administrators can use this tool to streamline large-scale user provisioning in enterprise or cloud environments.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB-f\fR \fIFILE\fR
Specify a file containing usernames (one per line). This allows bulk user creation from a predefined list.

.TP
\fB-G\fR \fIGROUP\fR
Assign users to a specific group. If the group does not exist, it will be created automatically.

.TP
\fB-u\fR \fISTART_UID\fR
Set the starting UID for the user accounts. If omitted, the system determines the next available UID.

.TP
\fB-s\fR \fISHELL\fR
Define the shell for new users. Defaults to \fB/bin/bash\fR.

.TP
\fB-p\fR \fIPASSWORD\fR
Set a password for all new users. If omitted, users are created with a default password (\fBPassword123\fR). It is recommended to force password changes on first login.

.TP
\fB-l\fR, \fB--log\fR
Enable logging of user creation events. Log entries are written to \fB/var/log/bulkuseradd.log\fR.

.TP
\fB-h\fR, \fB--help\fR
Display help information and exit.

.SH FEATURES
- **Batch processing**: Supports multiple users from command-line arguments or files.
- **Customizable UID assignment**: Set a starting UID or allow the system to auto-assign.
- **Group management**: Assign existing groups or create new ones.
- **Shell configuration**: Choose the default shell for new users.
- **Logging support**: Keep track of all user creation activities.

.SH EXAMPLES
**Example 1: Add users from a file and assign them to a group**
.PP
.EX
bulkuseradd -f users.txt -G developers -s /bin/zsh -p SecurePass!
.EE
This command reads usernames from \fBusers.txt\fR, assigns them to the "developers" group, sets their shell to \fB/bin/zsh\fR, and applies the password "SecurePass!".

**Example 2: Create multiple users with a specific UID range**
.PP
.EX
bulkuseradd user1 user2 user3 -G engineering -u 2000 -s /bin/bash
.EE
This command creates \fBuser1, user2,\fR and \fBuser3\fR, assigns them to "engineering", starts their UID from \fB2000\fR, and sets their shell to \fB/bin/bash\fR.

**Example 3: Enable logging for user creation**
.PP
.EX
bulkuseradd -f newusers.txt -l
.EE
This command creates users from \fBnewusers.txt\fR and logs the process to \fB/var/log/bulkuseradd.log\fR.

**Example 4: Assign different shells to users**
.PP
.EX
bulkuseradd -f employees.txt -s /bin/sh
.EE
All users from \fBemployees.txt\fR will have \fB/bin/sh\fR as their login shell.

**Example 5: Force UID auto-detection**
.PP
.EX
bulkuseradd userA userB userC
.EE
This command creates three users with system-generated UIDs and default group assignments.

.SH SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS
- It is highly recommended to enforce password expiration policies after creating new users:
  .EX
  chage -d 0 username
  .EE
  This forces the user to change their password upon first login.

- Ensure user accounts are properly managed by integrating with a directory service such as LDAP for enterprise environments.
